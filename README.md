# Literature notes

This is going to be a repository with papers (or possibly links if we don't want to add the papers themselves for any reason) as well as some notes on them.

People can always add notes, so this is a bit of a living document. We'll also try to group them according to which part of the TCER framework they fall under:

- theory development
- controlled experiments
- research synthesis
- practical research
- scalable applications of smaller research
