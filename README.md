# Literature Notes

This is a repository with papers (or possibly links if we don't want to add the papers themselves for any reason) as well as some notes on them. People can always add notes, so this is a bit of a living document.   

This folder is set up as an obsidian vault. Each paper has its own folder with a README summary, the PDF paper (often), and any other related materials.  The summaries or tagged with all TCER phase they relate to:
