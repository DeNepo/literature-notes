Provides a good overview on the connection between the construct (what we assume the students knows, can do) and the observable behavior present in the task, which is measured (assessed) by reference to the rubric.

Unfortunately missing a bunch of figures, since this is likely a pre-publication draft, though the discussion is very clear and easy to follow.

Makes very clear that the data for assessments is observable behavior of the student.

- The Student Model: What complex of knowledge, skills, or other attributes should be assessed?

For our purposes, this is one of the main questions we need to figure out. There isn't a lot of great research on "what do programmers do?" or "what makes a good programmer?". In that sense, measuring the product is a more straightforward way to assess skills (highly reliable, but potentially less valid). If we assume that web developers need to be able to:

- use the chrome console to debug errors
- use async functions in typescript code
- read code in order to add a new feature

then it's a good starting point to define the end state, but it doesn't tell us a lot about how to go about practicing doing that, nor if there are any intermediate steps along the way to further decompose the task.

The "Task Model" as presented in this paper is a lot closer to the above "objectives", but again, there doesn't seem to be much existing research enumerating what working programmers actually need to do, nor is it very clear how this research would be conducted and what the methods would be (questionnaires? observation? something else that's actually scalable?).

Goes into a fair bit of depth on the statistical models underpinning reliability, though has a very nice section on Item Response Theory and how it tells us about the particular configuration of items (basically which distractors are good and which items are telling us useful information).

Doesn't go into any detail about how to choose relevant constructs/tasks, though this has important implications for the learning objectives, and vice versa, but as an introductory paper to someone who isn't familiar with general psychometric principles, it's very good.
