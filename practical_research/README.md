Discusses use of log data collected via the IDE for students during task completion. The two main measurements are:

coarse-grained time on task (time from first keystrok to submission of exercise)
fine-grained time on task (sum of latencies between keystrokes until submission of exercise, with all breaks of 10+ minutes removed)

The results support the assertion that _in this particular context_, the finer-grained data was more predictive of success in the course summative assements.

However, it doesn't tell us anything about whether those assessments are in any way valid, or are actually measuring relevant constructs about the students' learning.

For our purposes, we would more easily be able to collect coarse-grained data (as defined above) in a web-app type of assessment instrument, since that's basically just two timestamps. Though it's an open question as to whether a very simple micromaterial is comparable to a more full-featured programming assignment (as was the object of study in this paper).
