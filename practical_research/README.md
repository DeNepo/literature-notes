Discusses use of log data collected via the IDE for students during task completion. The two main measurements are:

coarse-grained time on task (time from first keystrok to submission of exercise)
fine-grained time on task (sum of latencies between keystrokes until submission of exercise, with all breaks of 10+ minutes removed)

The results support the assertion that _in this particular context_, the finer-grained data was more predictive of success in the course summative assements.

However, it doesn't tell us anything about whether those assessments are in any way valid, or are actually measuring relevant constructs about the students' learning.

For our purposes, we would more easily be able to collect coarse-grained data (as defined above) in a web-app type of assessment instrument, since that's basically just two timestamps. Though it's an open question as to whether a very simple micromaterial is comparable to a more full-featured programming assignment (as was the object of study in this paper).

Mentions prior research suggesting that developers spend a lot of time interacting with others in order to fill their purely "technical" software creation activities.

Highlights hypothesis generation (P and possibly I of PRIMM) as an authentic developer task.

Interesting that one of the very common technical challenges was working with version control (probably because nobody teaches git in university).

Discusses the vast differences between team projects at universities (completely new and greenfield) with real-world assignments in pre-existing legacy systems with lacking documentation and situated in sociotechnical and political contexts. It would be much more valuable to present students with large pre-existing codebases with bugs that need to be triaged and fixed.

A particularly interesting note is the recommendation to explicitly teach the process of finding, documenting and triaging bugs **without** fixing them immediately.

For our purposes, given that one of the major findings was that non-technical issues of collaboration and interaction were something students needed more work with, a learning space approach with contextualized collaboration as a necessary condition and aspect of the environment is supported by this work.

## Exploring the use of faded worked examples as a problem solving approach for underprepared students

Focused on Chemistry, but broadly applicable as a framework for presenting certain types of programming problems via a web-UI.

Shows not only the actual calculation to be applied at each step, but a prose-description of what's happening. There was a _little_ bit of "why" given here (reminded of labelled sub-goals), but it was a bit difficult to parse out.

Showed the that underperforming group ended up outperforming the originally "advanced" group in both categories in the final exam (multiple choice and open-ended questions).

The intervention amounted to an additional 17.5 hours of instruction over the course of 14 weeks, so it's very possible that also contributed to the results.

For our purposes, would be interesting to see what types of problems lend themselves to the worked example format, and further, if there's a particular data structure to return from an API that would allow a web-based frontend to consume and programmatically present these as activities for learners.
