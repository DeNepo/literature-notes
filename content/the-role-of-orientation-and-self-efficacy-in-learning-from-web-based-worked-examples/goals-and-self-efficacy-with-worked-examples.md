Based on self-reported data, though still very interesting in the way it highlights the differences between particular goal orientations (ie, mastery vs. performance), and how these impact, and are in turn impacted by, worked examples. Leverages prior findings that a growth mindset is beneficial for learning and correlates with the drive towards mastery.

An interesting question, not addressed here, is whether it's possible to facilitate the transition in students from one goal orientation to another. It might be possible to engender a productive engagement with adversity such that they come to see effort as a determinant of success, where learners are drawn to challenges and frame failures as learning opportunities.

Mentions the "expertise reversal effect", where worked examples interfere with learning as domain expertise increases.

The methodology incorporates what the authors refer to as "trace data", which seems to be web-server logs, and it would be interesting to investigate the extent to which something like this could be abstracted and generalized for various web-based learning environments.

The main finding of the study was that a mastery-approach orientation was the strongest predictor of achievement. Given that the availability of worked examples (either faded or not) was indicated as an avenue for students with a performance-orientation to improve and enhance self-efficacy, that might be a consideration in the context of differentiated instruction and available self-study materials.
