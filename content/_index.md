# Literature Notes

This is a repository with papers and other links as well as some notes on them. People can always add notes, so this is a bit of a living document. This folder is set up as an obsidian vault. Each paper has its own folder with a README summary, the PDF paper (often), and any other related materials.

The main tags are the research phases from TCER:

- Theoretical CER
  - **#phase-1a**: General or borrowed theory
  - **#phase-1b**: CE-specific theories
- Experimental CER:
  - **#phase-2a**: Designed artifacts for controlled experiments
  - **#phase-2b**: Controlled experiments
- Research Synthesis:
  - **#phase-3a**: Academic literature reviews
  - **#phase-3b**: Practitioner-facing guides
- Applied CER:
  - **#phase-4a**: Evidence-based prototypes
  - **#phase-4b**: Practitioner reports and feedback
- Impact at Scale:
  - **#phase-5a**: Scaled interventions
  - **#phase-5b**: Reports and feedback

There are three additional tags for CER references that are not research or interventions:

- **#reflexive**: Introspective references that are _about_ CER as a field.
- **#outreach**: Outreach efforts from the CER community that are not specifically about sharing best-practices
- **#phase-XY-tz**: References from another field but are related to or inspiring for CER. The `XY` can be replaced by any TCER phase, and the `tz` stands for "_trading zone_"
