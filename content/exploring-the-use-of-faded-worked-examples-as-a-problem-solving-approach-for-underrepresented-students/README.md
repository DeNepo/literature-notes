Focused on Chemistry, but broadly applicable as a framework for presenting certain types of programming problems via a web-UI.

Shows not only the actual calculation to be applied at each step, but a prose-description of what's happening. There was a _little_ bit of "why" given here (reminded of labelled sub-goals), but it was a bit difficult to parse out.

Showed the that underperforming group ended up outperforming the originally "advanced" group in both categories in the final exam (multiple choice and open-ended questions).

The intervention amounted to an additional 17.5 hours of instruction over the course of 14 weeks, so it's very possible that also contributed to the results.

For our purposes, would be interesting to see what types of problems lend themselves to the worked example format, and further, if there's a particular data structure to return from an API that would allow a web-based frontend to consume and programmatically present these as activities for learners.
